# Lano Global Payroll Solution: Hire in 170+ Countries, Streamline Multi-Country Payroll, Stay 100% Compliant

Picture this: You're running a growing tech company, and your business just landed a major client in Germany. You need to hire a developer there, fast. But then reality hits—you'd need to set up a legal entity, navigate German labor laws, figure out tax compliance, and somehow manage payroll in a completely different system. The whole process could take months and cost a fortune.

This is exactly the kind of headache that makes business owners want to pull their hair out. And honestly? It's the sort of thing that holds a lot of companies back from going global, even when the opportunity is sitting right there in front of them.

Enter Lano, a platform that's been making waves in the global employment space since 2018. Based in Berlin with a team spread across 16 countries (they practice what they preach), Lano has built something pretty interesting—a way for companies to hire, manage, and pay people in over 170 countries without all the traditional hassle.

## What Lano Actually Does

Let me break this down in plain English. Lano is basically a one-stop platform for managing global teams. Whether you're hiring full-time employees in countries where you don't have an office, managing freelancers across different continents, or trying to wrangle payroll data from multiple providers into something coherent, Lano's got tools for that.

The platform offers four main services:

**Employer of Record (EOR)**: This is where Lano acts as the legal employer in a country where you don't have a legal entity. You find the talent, Lano handles the contracts, compliance, benefits, taxes—all the bureaucratic stuff. One company mentioned they saved potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars using this approach instead of setting up their own entities.

**Global Payroll Consolidation**: If you're already running payroll through different providers in different countries, Lano can bring all that data into one dashboard. Instead of logging into five different systems to see what's going on, you get a single view of everything. Pretty handy when you've got 350 employees spread across 17 countries.

**Contractor Management**: For the freelancer economy folks, Lano makes it easier to onboard contractors, handle invoices, and make payments in their local currency. The platform supports payments in over 50 currencies.

**Multi-Country Payroll**: Need to run payroll in countries where you do have entities? Lano connects with local payroll providers (they've got about 150 vetted partners) and standardizes the process so you're not reinventing the wheel every month.

## The Real-World Appeal

What makes Lano interesting isn't just the features—it's the speed. According to their data, they can onboard new employees abroad in under two weeks, and help companies enter new markets in less than six months. That's a significant acceleration compared to the traditional route of setting up legal entities, which can drag on for months.

One user review particularly stood out: "We were able to completely overhaul our payroll process. Now we use only one platform which automatically updates all the inputs from other systems and providers. Great time saver."

Another reviewer mentioned, "From all the platforms we tried in the space, Lano by far has some of the nicest people who are genuinely trying to help our team succeed with our payroll management across a few countries."

The platform seems to shine particularly bright for mid-sized companies (think 50-2,000 employees) that are in growth mode and expanding internationally. It's that sweet spot where you're big enough that managing global payroll manually is a nightmare, but not so massive that you need an enterprise-grade custom solution.

## Pricing: What You're Actually Looking At

Lano's pricing is modular, which makes sense given that different companies have wildly different needs. Here's the breakdown based on current 2026 information:

| Service | Pricing | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Payroll Consolidation** | From €3/employee/month | Unifies data from multiple payroll systems into one dashboard |
| **Multi-Country Payroll** | From €19/employee/month | Full payroll processing; may include per-provider setup fees |
| **Contractor Management** | From €19/contractor/month | Onboarding, contracts, invoicing, payments; no setup fees |
| **Employer of Record (EOR)** | From €499/employee/month | Full employment services including compliance, benefits, taxes; no setup fees |

The pricing scales with your scope—more countries, more entities, add-ons like incorporation or local accounting support will adjust the numbers. But the structure is straightforward: pay for what you use, and you can start small and scale up as your global footprint grows.

Worth noting: there's a free trial available, and billing is flexible (EUR, USD, GBP accepted). For companies just dipping their toes into international hiring, the contractor management option at €19/month is a pretty low-risk way to start.

## The Details That Matter

**Coverage**: Lano operates in 170+ countries. That's nearly every market you'd realistically want to hire in. They work through a network of vetted local partners rather than trying to maintain their own legal entities everywhere, which keeps things flexible.

**Compliance**: This is arguably where Lano earns its keep. They handle local labor laws, tax regulations, statutory benefits—the stuff that can get companies in serious trouble if done wrong. For businesses expanding internationally, having local HR and legal experts on tap is a big deal.

**Integrations**: The platform connects with common HRIS tools like BambooHR, Bob, Workday, and accounting systems like Xero and QuickBooks. So if you're already using other HR software, you can likely sync everything up without too much headache.

**Payments**: Multi-currency support (28+ currencies), bulk payment runs, competitive foreign exchange rates. You can pay everyone from one platform rather than managing multiple bank transfers.

**Speed**: The onboarding process for new hires typically takes days instead of months. For companies moving fast, this matters.

## Real User Experiences

The reviews are a mixed bag, as they are with most software. The positive feedback tends to focus on a few themes:

- Responsive, helpful support team that actually seems to care about solving problems
- Fast onboarding compared to traditional methods  
- Clean, intuitive interface once you get the hang of it
- The payroll consolidation feature gets a lot of love from companies managing teams across multiple countries

On the flip side, some users mention:

- Initial learning curve can be steep
- Working through local partners occasionally means extra back-and-forth to resolve complex situations
- Some invoicing quirks and occasional technical glitches
- Customer support response times can vary

One particularly honest review noted they're "a bit pricier than competitors, but so far they've been worth it." That seems to capture the trade-off pretty well—you're paying for quality service and a more comprehensive solution.

## Who Should Consider Lano?

Based on the research and user feedback, Lano seems like a strong fit for:

- **Fast-growing startups and scaleups** looking to hire internationally without the overhead of setting up legal entities
- **Mid-sized companies (50-2,000 employees)** expanding into new markets  
- **Businesses with distributed teams** across multiple countries who are tired of juggling different payroll systems
- **Companies in tech, digital services, e-commerce** where remote work and global talent are the norm
- **HR and finance teams** that want to consolidate their global payroll data in one place

It's probably overkill if you're only hiring domestically or have just a handful of contractors. And if you're a massive enterprise with super complex custom requirements, you might need something more bespoke. But for that wide middle ground of companies growing internationally, Lano offers a practical solution.

## The Bottom Line

Lano isn't trying to be everything to everyone. It's a focused platform solving a specific problem: making global hiring and payroll management less painful. They've built a system that lets you test new markets quickly, hire compliantly without local entities, and keep all your payroll data in one place.

The platform has clearly resonated with a growing number of companies—they're serving over 2,000 businesses worldwide and have raised $12.5M in funding from solid investors like Spark Capital and TX Ventures. The team knows what they're doing, and the reviews suggest they're genuinely invested in customer success.

Is it perfect? No software is. There's a learning curve, pricing can add up as you scale, and you're ultimately relying on their network of local partners. But for companies serious about building global teams without the traditional overhead, Lano offers a genuinely useful solution.

The best part? You can try it out with a free trial and see if it fits your workflow before committing. If you're currently wrestling with international payroll, spending hours on compliance research, or putting off hiring that perfect candidate because they're in another country, it's worth checking out.
